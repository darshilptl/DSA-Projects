## üß† **Data Structures and Algorithms Practiced**

1. **Arrays**:
   - Used for sequential data handling.
   - Learned how to reduce time complexity for search operations.
   - Example: Solved **Two Sum** using HashMaps to achieve O(n) complexity.
2. **HashMaps**:

   - Applied for quick lookups and managing key-value pairs efficiently.
   - Challenges: Handled duplicate keys and null values efficiently.

3. **Stacks**:

   - Utilized for Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) operations.
   - Solved problems like **Balanced Brackets** by pushing and popping elements based on conditions.

4. **Dynamic Programming (if applicable)**:
   - Applied **Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm** for maximum subarray sum.
   - Learned to optimize recursion with memoization techniques.

1. **Learning Moments**:
   - **Understanding trade-offs**: Balancing space vs. time complexity while solving Two Sum using HashMaps.
   - **Edge Cases**: Debugging for scenarios like empty strings, invalid inputs, or edge elements in Arrays.
2. **Challenges**:
   - Optimizing brute-force solutions to efficient algorithms.
   - Encountered stack overflow issues during recursion but resolved by restructuring the base cases.
3. **Progress**:
   - Improved my problem-solving speed by focusing on pre-defined patterns.
   - Gained confidence in applying **HashMaps** and **Stacks** to real-world problems.
